spec:
  description: >-
    This task can be used to perform git operations.

    Git command that needs to be run can be passed as a script to
    the task. This task needs authentication to git in order to push
    after the git operation.

  workspaces:
    - name: source
      description: A workspace that contains the fetched git repository.

    - name: input
      optional: true
      description: |
        An optional workspace that contains the files that need to be added to git. You can
        access the workspace from your script using `$(workspaces.input.path)`, for instance:

          cp $(workspaces.input.path)/file_that_i_want .
          git add file_that_i_want
          # etc

    - name: ssh-directory
      optional: true
      description: |
        A .ssh directory with private key, known_hosts, config, etc. Copied to
        the user's home before git commands are executed. Used to authenticate
        with the git remote when performing the clone. Binding a Secret to this
        Workspace is strongly recommended over other volume types.

    - name: basic-auth
      optional: true
      description: |
        A Workspace containing a .gitconfig and .git-credentials file. These
        will be copied to the user's home before any git commands are run. Any
        other files in this Workspace are ignored. It is strongly recommended
        to use ssh-directory over basic-auth whenever possible and to bind a
        Secret to this Workspace over other volume types.

    - name: BASE_IMAGE
      description: |
